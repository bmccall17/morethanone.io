# v0.0.4 - demo mode

**released:** feb 9, 2026

## summary
Adds a standalone demo mode at `/demo` with 3 predefined scenarios, step-by-step playback, plain-language explanations, and a composite view showing host tallies alongside mock participant perspectives.

---

## changes
- Added 3 predefined demo scenarios with hand-crafted ballot data verified against the converge engine:
  - **Early Leader, Late Overtake** — 5 options, 15 ballots, C wins via redistributed secondary preferences
  - **Polarizing Favorite vs Steady Consensus** — 4 options, 12 ballots, B wins via consensus
  - **Comeback from Third Position** — 6 options, 18 ballots, C wins via layered preferences
- Created `DemoRunner` engine wrapper for step-by-step playback with dynamically generated explanations
- Created `MockParticipantCard` component showing individual ballot state with strikethrough/highlight indicators
- Created `DemoTallyView` component — controlled bar chart (same visual language as `RevealAnimation`, manually stepped)
- Built composite demo page with scenario selector, host panel, participant grid, step controls, explanations toggle, and teachable moment card
- Added "See how it works" link on the home page navigating to `/demo`
- Updated sprint backlog: all 5 demo mode tasks marked complete
