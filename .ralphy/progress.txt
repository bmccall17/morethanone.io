# Ralphy Progress Log
- [✓] 2026-02-09 14:19 - Update the `Round` type in `src/types/database.ts` to add `host_as_participant: boolean` to the `settings` object (default `false`). Also add `show_processing: boolean` (default `false`) to the settings object while here since it's needed for feature 2.
- [✓] 2026-02-09 14:21 - Add a migration at `supabase/migrations/add_host_settings.sql` that updates existing rounds to include the new settings defaults. Add a comment noting the settings column is JSONB and these are new keys within it.
- [✓] 2026-02-09 17:23 - Add a "Participate in this round" toggle to the host lobby page at `src/app/host/[roundId]/lobby/page.tsx`. Place it in the host controls area before the action buttons. When toggled on, send a PATCH/POST to update the round settings with `host_as_participant: true`. Use the existing `Toggle` component from `src/components/ui/Toggle.tsx`. The toggle should only be available during `setup` status and disabled after ranking starts.
- [✓] 2026-02-09 17:25 - Create an API route at `src/app/api/rounds/[roundId]/settings/route.ts` that accepts PATCH requests with a JSON body to update the round's settings column. Require the `X-Host-Token` header for authentication (follow the same pattern as `src/app/api/rounds/[roundId]/start/route.ts`). Merge the incoming settings with existing settings (spread operator, not replace).
- [✓] 2026-02-09 17:28 - When `host_as_participant` is enabled and the host clicks "Start ranking", automatically create a participant record for the host. Modify `src/app/api/rounds/[roundId]/start/route.ts` to check the round's `host_as_participant` setting — if true, insert a participant row with `display_name: 'Host'` and `round_id`, then return the new participant ID in the response. The host lobby page should store this participant ID in localStorage (same pattern as the join flow in `src/app/join/page.tsx`).
- [✓] 2026-02-09 17:30 - When the host is a participant, show the ranking interface to the host after they click "Start ranking". In `src/app/host/[roundId]/lobby/page.tsx`, when status is `ranking` and the host has a participant ID in localStorage, render the `DraggableRankList` component from `src/components/DraggableRankList.tsx` inline within the lobby page (above the submission counter and close button). After the host submits their ranking, hide the ranking UI and show a "Ranking submitted" confirmation. The host should still see all host controls (submission counter, close ranking button) alongside their ranking UI.
- [✓] 2026-02-09 17:32 - Add a "Show live processing to participants" toggle to the host lobby page at `src/app/host/[roundId]/lobby/page.tsx`. Place it near the "Participate" toggle. When toggled, update round settings via the settings API route created above with `show_processing: true`. This toggle should only be available during `setup` status. Use the existing `Toggle` component.
- [✓] 2026-02-09 17:34 - Add a new round status value `processing` to the `RoundStatus` type in `src/types/database.ts`. The flow becomes: `setup → ranking → processing → revealed`. Update the status transition in `src/app/api/rounds/[roundId]/close/route.ts` to set status to `processing` instead of `closed` when `show_processing` is enabled in the round settings. When `show_processing` is disabled, keep the existing `closed` status.
- [✓] 2026-02-09 17:39 - Create an API route at `src/app/api/rounds/[roundId]/process/route.ts` for stepping through the ranked-choice algorithm. When called with POST, it should: (1) run the `converge()` function from `src/lib/engine/converge.ts`, (2) store each round's data incrementally by updating a `processing_data` column on the results table (or a new `round_processing` table), and (3) broadcast each round's result via Supabase Realtime by updating the round row with a `current_processing_round` integer field. Require `X-Host-Token` authentication.
- [✓] 2026-02-09 17:41 - Add a realtime subscription helper `subscribeToProcessing(roundId, callbacks)` in `src/lib/realtime.ts` that listens for UPDATE events on the `rounds` table and calls `onProcessingUpdate(roundNumber)` when `current_processing_round` changes. Participants use this to know when new round data is available to fetch and display.
