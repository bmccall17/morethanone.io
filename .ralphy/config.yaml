rules:
  - "Check supabase/schema.sql before adding columns — if a column is referenced in a SELECT but missing from schema.sql, add it to schema.sql and create a migration file"
  - "Do NOT modify devnotes/ planning files (prd.md, prdnextsteps.md, prdparkinglot.md, sprint backlogs). Only modify the sprint backlog you were given as --prd to check off completed tasks"
  - "When creating new database columns or settings fields, always update src/types/database.ts AND supabase/schema.sql"
